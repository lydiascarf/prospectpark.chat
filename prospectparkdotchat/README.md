A realtime photo sharing app built on Supabase and Riverpod.

[Supabase](https://supabase.io) is an open-source Firebase alternative that offers a set of tools to create scalable and secure web and mobile applications. 

On the other hand, [Riverpod](https://docs-v2.riverpod.dev/) is a state management library for Flutter that provides a simple, composable way of managing application state. It uses dependency injection to enable sharing state across the app and offers an intuitive API for managing state.

## Getting started

1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (_Includes Dart SDK_)
2. Update packages with `flutter pub get`
3. Run project with `flutter run`
